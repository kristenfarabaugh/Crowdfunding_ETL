# Crowdfunding_ETL
Group 7 (comprised of Ehsan Shahrabi, Hiromi Miyata, Kristen Farabaugh, Marcy Fang and Mirian Ruanova) all equally contributed to the project and furthered their knowledge of Python, SQL and Pandas. The team approached this project in a collaborative manner - during our meetings, one person would share their screen (and write the code), while all others were active participants in suggesting code, bug fixes, different ways to approach things, etc. Each group member can explain every line of the code if needed, as demonstrated in the review with Paulo. 

Please note: the group decided to opt for 'Option 2' (using Regex to analyze the data). You'll see Option 1 present in the code; this is because certain group members played around with the code in their off time in an effort to learn :) Please grade on Option 2.
